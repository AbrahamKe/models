<p>The applet requires Java 5 or higher.
Java must be enabled in your browser settings.

Windows and Linux users may obtain the latest Java from

<p><hr>

<p><font size="-1">In order for this to work, this file and the file HubNet.jar
must be in the same directory.  (You can copy HubNet.jar
from the directory where you installed NetLogo.)</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">On some systems, you can test the applet locally on your computer
before uploading it to a web server.  It doesn't work on all systems,
though, so if it doesn't work from your hard drive, please try
uploading it to a web server.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">You don't need to include everything in this file in your page.
If you want, you can just take the HTML code beginning with
&lt;applet&gt; and ending with &lt;/applet&gt;, and paste it into any HTML
file you want.  It's even OK to put multiple &lt;applet&gt; tags
on a single page.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">If HubNet.jar is in a different directory you must
modify the archive= line in the HTML code to point
to its actual location. (For example, if you have 
multiple applets in different directories on the same
web server, you may want to put a single copy of
HubNet.jar in one central place and change the
archive= lines of all the HTML files to point to that
one central copy.  This will save disk space for you and
download time for your users.)</font></p>

<p><font size="-1">To run this activity you must run the server in NetLogo
on the same server that you are hosting the webpage. This
webpage must be accessible to the webserver user.  To login
users should navigate to this webpage and enter a user name
and the port as displayed in the HubNet Control Center.</font></p>
